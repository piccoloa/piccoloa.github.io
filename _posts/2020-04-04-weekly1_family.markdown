### **What I’m Reading**

Below is a list of articles I’ve come across over the past few weeks and tracked using the [Feedly app](https://feedly.com) on my computer, iPhone and iPad. I'm an avid user of google keep despite being uncomfortable with the amount of data Google tracks. A topic for another post. The reason I started using a news reader app is I am convinced that what we read and watch from the internet is highly biased by our digital fingerprint and pulling humanity apart while making the technology provider an agent our identity in society both on and off-line. It’s not only the algorithms that are separating us based on out [“identity”](https://piccoloa.github.io/entityresolution_over/), but the owners and editors of the sites we visit are highly incentivized and unchecked as they are rewarded based on one important factor __getting our attention__.  
Studying informatics in graduate school and more than 25 years of technology industry research both as an institutional investor and employee of a software company have formed my opinion. A small resolve to staying informed and attempting to correct this highly biased digital view of the world is to use electronic readers like Feedly as their “old technology” only retrieves an article's title and summary from a website in feeds the user controls. The feeds are picked by the user are aggregated without applying knowledge of the user's identity requesting access to the article. The only filter for __the news source you choose__ is the time that it was published by the website/ content provider.  
I try to pay particular attention to the author’s credentials for articles especially those in the “Worth Sharing” section. The categories other than _Worth Sharing_ are listed to help you skim what I have been reading and we might have in common.  Any pasted links or opinions you share in the comments below are much appreciated.
