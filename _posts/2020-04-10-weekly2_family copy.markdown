### **What I’m Reading**
News I read last week with excerpts.

### Worth Sharing

*News that made me think harder or want to know more from the experts.*



**Data and emotions**  
[Golden: Our veterans deserve better](https://moremonmouthmusings.net/2020/04/09/golden-our-veterans-deserve-better/)  
>Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden is upset about the care that military veterans are getting and and the attention that the media is giving to the plight of inmates in State and County prisons compared to the sparse coverage the media is giving convalescing vets in state run homes.  “This is shameful,” Golden said of reports that the high rate of mortality at New Jersey’s veterans homes since the COVID-19 pandemic broke. “We hear more about our inmates than our veterans. Everyday I receive calls from reporters on the status of inmates and there is blanket coverage on those in the jail, yet there’s sparse coverage on our veterans.”  

At first site, I found this article a bit distrubing. My previous experiences with [this website](https://moremonmouthmusings.net) is limited besides the useful additional links to other Monmouth county local news written by local authors. I discovered by accident that this site on Facebook is also a troll for classifying and spreading fear and hate to the readers and dividing people into political groups. That said, it's my thoughts that articles such as this while having good intentions become fuel for trolls and are used by classificaton algorithims to categorize and bait digital readers. While it's not difficult to factually argue that the media is not reportng more about jails then impacted veterans, the facts or depth of those stories I have read have been poor in explaining why incarcieration is so critical in fighting the spread of the virus. Yes, without additional facts and insight anyone would find it hard to dispute the skewed demographics of those impacted by the virus. Knowing this, we need to better understand how populations are impacted before jumping to emotional conclusions about society and news for the sake of capturing our attention. The articles that follow helped me better understand how the data needs to be better understood before we let sensational journalism and trolls control our emotions and actions.  

[Why Jails Are So Important in the Fight Against Coronavirus | The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/03/31/why-jails-are-so-important-in-the-fight-against-coronavirus)  
>“Density is bad—we know that,” said Barun Mathema, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University who was part of a team that studied the spread of tuberculosis in a prison in Brazil. The team found that people entered the prison with low rates of infection. Within six months, their rates had shot up 30 times, and remained elevated for years after release. The prison drove the disease not only inside its walls, but also in the neighboring community, where predicted rates of infection rose, according to models of the general population.

[Dr. Fauci says the coronavirus is 'shining a bright light' on 'unacceptable' health disparities for African Americans ](https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-covid-19-shows-unacceptable-disparities-for-african-americans-2020-4)  
>"And the reason I want to bring it up, because I couldn't help sitting there reflecting on how sometimes when you're in the middle of a crisis, like we are now with the coronavirus, it really does have, ultimately, shine a very bright light on some of the real weaknesses and foibles in our society," Fauci said.

When I see something to be hopeful about, I’ll say so, and when I think people are getting ahead of what we know, I’ll say that, too.
