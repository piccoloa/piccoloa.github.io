I am passionate about knowledge creation and harnessing the power of data driven decisions to build value and create exceptional growth. My career has centered on results driven outcomes starting from ideation to working across organizations to define, manage, and launch initiatives that consistently surpass expectations.  
Starting with an infectious positive attitude and self driven motivation, I enjoy solving hard problems by motivating and leading teams to overachieve against business goals and release their true potential individually and collectively. As a thought leader and trusted adviser in analyzing and implementing emerging and high-growth technology strategies, I am known for applying imaginative knowledge based intelligence to real world outcomes.
Driving necessary strategic and transformational change fuels my ambitions.
