This site is about owning a digital footprint and sharing. I enjoy learning and creating stuff. I am also a bit of an addict in measuring what I do and sometimes this is healthy and other times its not. I consider the algorithms of today as symbols and custodians of our data. The data we share becomes an inferred context and agents of our identity. My fear is the networks of our digital world have inadvertiently engineered unhealthy bias by measuring data optimized to the wrong incentives. The context and the identity we want to project doesnâ€™t matter to a system which is biased and steered by those who will pay the most for capturing our attention. In short, the data created on this blog and shared is an attempt to circumvent this bias.
